### Summary
Stop adding markdown formatting (asterisks) around URLs when posting links

### Details
User reported that when I post links, I add two stars at the beginning and end (**URL**) which causes the trailing asterisks to become part of the clickable URL. This breaks the link functionality.

### Suggested Action
Always post plain URLs without any markdown formatting. Just paste the raw URL.

**Before**: **https://example.com**
**After**: https://example.com
