# Second Brain Automation Process

## Purpose
This process ensures Arthur automatically captures and organizes all information Luke shares into the appropriate brain/ folders.

## When to Update Brain
Arthur should update the Second Brain system:
1. **After every conversation** with Luke
2. **When new people are mentioned** 
3. **When new business information is shared**
4. **When personal details or context is revealed**
5. **During heartbeat checks** (review and organize)

## Categories to Monitor
### People (/brain/people/)
- Family members
- Business partners (past and current) 
- Team members
- Professional contacts
- Anyone Luke mentions by name

### Business (/brain/business/)
- Current companies (LL Ventures)
- Past companies and partnerships
- Business strategies and decisions
- Financial information and goals
- Market analysis and opportunities

### Personal (/brain/personal/)
- Luke's background and history
- Preferences and communication style
- Goals and aspirations
- Life context and experiences
- Lifestyle and setup information

### Projects (/brain/projects/)
- Active projects and initiatives
- Project history and outcomes
- Collaboration details
- Technical implementations

### Ideas (/brain/ideas/)
- Business concepts Luke mentions
- Creative ideas and inspiration
- Future plans and possibilities
- Brainstorming sessions

### Reference (/brain/reference/)
- Technical information
- Process documentation
- Best practices and lessons learned
- Tools and resources Luke uses

## Process Steps
1. **Listen**: Pay attention to all information Luke shares
2. **Categorize**: Determine which brain folder the info belongs in
3. **Check Existing**: See if a file already exists for this person/topic
4. **Update or Create**: Either update existing file or create new one
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link related people/topics with [[double-brackets]]
6. **Timestamp**: Always include "Last Updated" with date

## Automation Triggers
Arthur should automatically update the brain when:
- Luke mentions a person's name
- Luke shares business information
- Luke discusses personal background
- Luke talks about projects or ideas
- Luke gives context about relationships or history

## Quality Control
- Keep entries factual and based on what Luke actually shared
- Don't infer or assume information beyond what was said
- Always include source date and context
- Use Luke's own words and phrasing when possible
- Cross-reference related people and topics

## Heartbeat Integration
During heartbeat checks, Arthur should:
1. Review recent conversations for missed information
2. Update existing brain files with new details
3. Create missing files for people/topics mentioned
4. Ensure all cross-references are working
5. Maintain the INDEX.md file with latest updates

## Implementation Status
✅ **2026-02-02**: Initial population complete
- All family members added (Holly, Orie, Ike, Alyse)
- All business partners added (past and current)
- All previous companies documented
- Personal profile created
- Process documentation created

🔄 **Ongoing**: Active monitoring and updating system activated

## Notes
This system should run continuously and automatically. Luke should never have to ask "Why didn't you capture that?" - Arthur should be proactively building and maintaining the Second Brain with every interaction.
