# 🧠 Second Brain

Luke's knowledge base, organized and maintained by Arthur.

## Quick Links

- [People](people/) — Who's who in Luke's world
- [Projects](projects/) — Active work with status and next steps
- [Business](business/) — Business context, strategies, deals
- [Personal](personal/) — Personal life, goals, preferences
- [Ideas](ideas/) — Things to explore, inspiration, half-baked thoughts
- [Reference](reference/) — Static info, accounts, how-tos

## How This Works

1. Luke shares info (voice, text, files)
2. Arthur categorizes and files it here
3. Cross-references link related things
4. Daily logs (`memory/`) capture the raw feed
5. This brain is the curated, organized version
