**Complete Implementation Guide:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ADw4OYTA1WXYCeY7djjJr0zSCYipkAMqF9YKyVIhfv8/

## Core Positioning

- **NOT:** James Bond sophisticated (misaligned with authentic Luke)
- **YES:** California beach casual + ruthlessly systematic
- **Tagline:** "The Systems Guy Who Actually Does The Deals"
- **Visual:** Black boardshorts, black t-shirt, black trucker hat, barefoot
- **Vibe:** Happy-go-lucky but accountable, Alex Hormozi consistency with Encinitas beach feel

## Content Strategy (Research-Based)

### What Actually Goes Viral in Real Estate:
1. Property analysis breakdowns (15-30 seconds)
2. "Red flags that made me walk away" content
3. Behind-the-scenes deal hunting
4. "Here's how I actually do it" vs theory
5. Market insights from real activity

### Perfect Workflow for Luke:
- Film existing 15hr/week underwriting sessions
- Screen record + face cam setup
- Overseas editor creates 20+ clips per week
- Post 3x daily across platforms
- Zero additional time investment needed

### Alex Hormozi Formula Applied:
- Document real work vs teaching theory
- "Here's how I did it" not "Here's how you should do it"
- Give away secrets, sell implementation
- Volume approach: 80+ pieces per week
- Build credibility through actual results

## Business Integration

**Goal:** Build network for JV partnerships and deal flow, NOT coaching business
**Strategy:** Content → Credibility → Conversations → Deals/Partnerships
**Monetization:** Investor attraction, deal referrals, strategic partnerships

## Top 10 Immediate Content Ideas

1. "My Exact Underwriting Spreadsheet" (screen recording)
2. "Red Flags I Walked Away From This Week" (compilation)  
3. "How I Found 5 Deals in 1 Hour" (time-lapse)
4. "Agent Just Told Me Something That Changed Everything"
5. "My Daily Deal Hunting Routine" (behind-the-scenes)
6. "Tools I Actually Use Every Day" (authentic recommendations)
7. "Mistakes I Made This Week" (vulnerable, educational)
8. "Section 8 vs Regular Rental Analysis" (educational)
9. "Why I'm Buying in Detroit (Not LA)" (contrarian take)
10. "Live Property Analysis" (real-time decision making)

## Key Insights from Research

- TikTok algorithm favors geographic content (perfect for Detroit focus)
- Authenticity beats production value
- Behind-the-scenes content outperforms polished content
- "How I did it" outperforms "How to do it" by massive margins
- Volume is crucial - need 3+ posts daily for algorithm success
- Real results create unquestionable authority

## Next Steps

1. Finalize brand positioning alignment
2. Set up simple recording workflow
3. Create first month of content using templates
4. Test and iterate based on performance
5. Scale with overseas editing team

This strategy positions Luke as the laid-back California expert who actually does the deals, building authority through authentic documentation of real work rather than theoretical teaching.
