# Luke Personal Brand - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 START THIS WEEK

### Immediate Setup (Week 1)

**Equipment Needed:**
- Screen recording software (OBS Studio - free)
- Face cam (your existing camera setup)
- Good lighting in Carlsbad office

**Content Creation Workflow:**
1. Turn on screen record + face cam during normal underwriting
2. Just do your normal 15 hours/week of work
3. Editor extracts 15-30 second clips of best moments
4. Post 3x daily: morning, afternoon, evening

### First 5 Videos to Make

1. **"My Exact Underwriting Process"** 
   - Screen record analyzing one actual deal
   - Show your spreadsheet/tools in real-time
   - End: "Would you buy this? Comment below"

2. **"Red Flags That Made Me Walk Away"**
   - Quick clips of 3-5 properties you rejected this week
   - 10 seconds each explaining why
   - Beach casual vibe, black trucker hat

3. **"How I Found 3 Deals in 20 Minutes"**
   - Time-lapse of actual Zillow searching
   - Show your real search criteria
   - Casual commentary over the footage

4. **"Tools I Actually Use Every Day"**
   - Quick tour of your actual desk setup
   - Show the software/spreadsheets you really use
   - "This is how I actually do it"

5. **"Agent Just Sent Me Something Interesting"**
   - React to actual deal from agent
   - Real-time analysis and decision
   - Shows your network/credibility

### Posting Strategy

**Platforms:** TikTok → Instagram Reels → YouTube Shorts (same content, platform-optimized)

**Schedule:**
- 8am: Educational content
- 2pm: Behind-the-scenes content  
- 7pm: Market insights/deal breakdowns

**Captions:**
- Keep it simple and conversational
- Always end with engagement question
- Use Luke-style casual language

### Growth Hacks from Research

1. **Geographic Algorithm:** TikTok shows your content to local people automatically
2. **Trending Audio:** Use popular sounds for property tours
3. **Completion Rate:** First 3 seconds determine everything - strong hooks
4. **Comments:** Reply to every comment for first 100 followers

### Alex Hormozi Framework Applied

**Instead of:** "How to analyze real estate deals"  
**Say:** "Here's how I analyzed 5 deals this morning"

**Instead of:** "You should look for these criteria"  
**Say:** "Here's what I'm looking for right now"

**Instead of:** "Best tools for real estate"  
**Say:** "Tools I actually use every single day"

### Business Integration

**Every 5th post:** Subtle business mention
- "DM me if you want to see the full analysis"
- "Link in bio for our current deal pipeline"  
- "This is the type of deal we do for investors"

### Metrics to Track

- **View completion rate** (aim for 70%+)
- **Comments per post** (engagement indicator)
- **Profile visits** (conversion to business)
- **DMs from content** (lead generation)

### Week 1 Goal

- 15 pieces of content created
- All platforms set up and posting
- Basic workflow established
- First engagement happening

This gets you started immediately with zero extra time investment since you're just filming what you already do.
