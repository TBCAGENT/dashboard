## Critical Learnings

### SMS Acquisition System (2026-02-05)

**TWO SEPARATE WORKFLOWS - Never confuse them:**

1. **Zillow Agent Responses** = We reached out about a SPECIFIC listing
   - We ALREADY HAVE: address, photos, asking price, Zillow URL
   - My ONLY job: Confirm rent amount
   - Once rent confirmed → Fill rent column → Status = "Deal Review Ready" → Clear draft
   - NEVER ask for address, photos, or asking price (we have them from Zillow!)

2. **Agent Responses (Cold Outreach)** = General "do you have anything?" messages
   - We have NOTHING
   - Need to discover: address, rent, asking price
   - Keep conversation going until we have all info

**HARD RULES:**
- SMS ONLY between 6 AM - 4 PM PST
- Casual tone, normal capitalization, no dashes
- All replies need Luke's approval
- Never mention AI/automation
