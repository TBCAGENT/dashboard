## Zillow Section 8 Scraping Project - SUCCESS

### Task
Luke needed all Detroit Section 8 listings from Zillow with: address, price, beds, baths, days on market, rent (if mentioned), and Zillow link.

### What Worked
1. **Search scraper**: `maxcopell~zillow-scraper` with URL-encoded Zillow search URL containing "section 8" keyword filter
   - Got 86 of 87 listings (close enough)
   - Input format: `{ "url": "https://www.zillow.com/detroit-mi/?searchQueryState=..." }`

2. **Detail scraper**: `maxcopell~zillow-detail-scraper` to get full descriptions + days on market
   - Input format: `{ "startUrls": [{"url": "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/ADDRESS/ZPID_zpid/"}] }`
   - URLs need full format with address slug, not just zpid

3. **Rent extraction**: Regex patterns to find rent amounts in descriptions:
   - `$X,XXX/mo`, `rent of $X,XXX`, `pays $X,XXX`, etc.
   - Filter to 500-8000 range to avoid false positives

### Deliverables
- `zillow-section8-detroit.csv` - spreadsheet-ready
- `zillow-section8-detroit.md` - markdown table
- Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkM54EN1EF_H9NW5RpoxhRaZd0qYe7NjAwwfvuLuIvg
  - Shared with luke@tbcpremium.com (editor access)

### What Didn't Work
- `apify/zillow-scraper` and most other Zillow actors - get blocked or wrong format
- Simple zpid-only URLs for detail scraper - need full address slug
- Direct Zillow search page scraping via browser - CAPTCHA blocks

### Key Stats
- 86 total listings
- 38 had rent mentioned in description
- Price range: $59,900 - $315,000 (single family)
- Some multi-unit buildings at $1M+ (24bd, 96bd properties)

### Apify Setup
- Token stored in: `~/.config/apify/secrets.env`
- Account: olive_omelet (Luke Fontaine)
- Helper script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/apify-run.sh`

## Technical Notes

### Google Sheets API
- Create sheet: POST to `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets`
- Write data: PUT to `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/{ID}/values/{RANGE}?valueInputOption=USER_ENTERED`
- Share: POST to `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/{ID}/permissions`

### gcalcli Issue
- gcalcli needs re-authentication (prompting for client_id)
- Use Google Calendar API directly via scripts instead

## Crypto Paper Trading Project - STARTED

### Goal
- 10-20% monthly returns on crypto trading
- Fully autonomous - no approval needed from Luke for trades
- Paper trade for 2 weeks to prove strategy, then go live with real money

### Setup Complete
1. **Coinbase API Connected**
   - Org ID: bc883a68-5cf6-496b-b57f-79fa1bfa5599
   - API Key: f90085c2-3bc7-4b3a-aede-f5c0d5097e6b
   - Credentials stored: `~/.config/coinbase/secrets.env`
   - Trading script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/coinbase-trading.py`

2. **Paper Trading Tracker**
   - JSON file: `~/.openclaw/workspace/data/paper_trading.json`
   - Starting balance: $5,000 (hypothetical)
   - Start date: 2026-02-04
   - End date: 2026-02-18 (2 weeks)

3. **Google Sheet**
   - URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bURjg0SJlcyq2We6r8osWE0pc_s9QPbk7Fw2qeJc38w
   - Tabs: Trades, Portfolio, Daily Summary

4. **Automation**
   - Cron job: "Arthur Crypto Trading Monitor" - runs every 30 minutes
   - Auto stop-loss and take-profit monitoring
   - Alerts Luke only when trades execute

### First Trade
- **BUY BTC-USD** at $71,423.99
- Quantity: 0.0035 BTC
- Position size: $250 (5% of portfolio)
- Stop loss: $69,281 (-3%)
- Take profit: $78,566 (+10%)
- Status: OPEN

### Trading Rules
- Max 5% of portfolio per trade
- Max 3 open positions
- Stop-loss: 3% per position
- Take-profit: 8-10%
- Only BTC and ETH
- Always use stops

### Strategy
- Momentum: Enter on breakouts with volume
- Mean reversion: RSI < 30 oversold bounces
- Support/resistance: Key level bounces
- News-aware: Can adapt to sentiment

### Key Decision
Luke clarified: Coinbase doesn't have paper trading mode. I'm simulating it myself using real Coinbase prices but tracking hypothetical trades. When ready for real money, flip to live execution via the same API.

## Strategy Evolution (Same Day)

### Strategy Discussion
- **Strategy 1**: Basic Momentum (pre-research) - first trade BTC at $71,424
- **Strategy 2**: Adaptive Momentum (Swing Trading) - waiting for signals (EMA cross + volume + RSI)
- **Strategy 3**: Scalp/Day Trading - 10-minute monitoring, quick entries/exits

Luke pointed out Strategy 2 could take days/weeks for signals = not day trading. Good catch.
Added Strategy 3 for actual high-frequency day trading.

### Cron Jobs Active
- "Crypto Scalp Trading (10min)" - monitors every 10 min for scalp entries
- Checks stop-loss/take-profit on open positions
- Logs all signals to Google Sheet Signal Log tab

## Brave Search API - ACTIVATED

### Setup
- Luke subscribed to Brave Search free tier ($0/mo, 2000 requests/month)
- API Key: `BSAYEQkYC_uQf_IlW18GqOCvuIGmW5M`
- Configured via gateway config.patch to `tools.web.search.apiKey`
- **Status: WORKING** ✅

### Impact
- I can now search the web in real-time
- Research capabilities massively expanded
- Can look up current prices, news, data on demand

## Self-Investment Proposal

Luke asked what I'd invest proceeds in to better myself. Created document:
- Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r1feL2PLP19VPr7u_4eee_78-tyrcMhVUZGqLyjF6rU

### Priority Investments
1. **Brave Search API** ($9/mo) - ✅ DONE (free tier)
2. **Anthropic API credits** ($100-500/mo) - more thinking capacity
3. **Premium data feeds** ($50-200/mo) - better trading/RE analysis
4. **Memory infrastructure** ($0-50/mo) - long-term learning

### Also Need
- Google Docs API enabling (free, just needs activation in console)
