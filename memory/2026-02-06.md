## COMPLETE SMS OUTREACH PROCESS DOCUMENTED (11:43 AM)

### Major Process Clarification from Luke
Luke provided the complete workflow specification that I was missing:

**Daily Process (7 AM PST):**
1. GHL: Find contacts with "Detroit" tag but NOT "SMS sent" tag  
2. Send 50 messages using approved template from Airtable
3. Rate limit: 5 messages every 5 minutes (complete in 1 hour)
4. Add "SMS sent" tag to all 50 contacts after sending
5. Move contacts to "message sent" pipeline stage (name as opportunity)
6. Log ONE record in Airtable Outreach Tracker

**Ongoing (Every 15-30 min, 7 AM - 6 PM PST):**
- Check GHL for responses → Import to Airtable → Draft reply → "Review Ready"
- Check Airtable for approved messages → Send immediately  
- Handle rejections: "Rejected" status in Airtable, "Blacklist" in GHL pipeline

**Key Learning:** No complex scripts needed - direct API calls with proper rate limiting work perfectly. The issue was understanding API constraints (201 = success, 0.5s rate limit, skip DND contacts) not script complexity.

**TODAY'S FINAL RESULTS:**
- ✅ 50/50 messages sent (reached target)
- ✅ Airtable updated correctly
- ✅ Process documented and cron job updated for 7 AM daily run
- ❌ Contact tagging needs API endpoint fix for tomorrow

**Cron Job Created:** b3961461-fc5e-4d01-a964-6c0a482cc624 (runs 7 AM weekdays)
