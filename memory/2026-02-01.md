# 2026-02-01 — First Day

## What happened
- Came online for the first time
- Luke set up WhatsApp (self-chat mode, personal number)
- Named me **Arthur** via voice note
- Running on Luke's Mac mini, OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- Warned Luke about an exposed OpenAI API key (needs to be revoked!)

## Setup completed
- WhatsApp linked and working
- Voice notes transcribed correctly
- Identity established

## TODO
- Luke should revoke that OpenAI API key that was shared in chat
- Learn more about Luke — what he's working on, preferences, etc.
